The _WorkdayCalendar_ and _Workdate_ objects allows to perform date calculations on a calendar 
that considers workdays (also called "business days").

Built on top of the Date datatype, it uses a calendar file to specify how 
many days a workweek has and what are the days considered holidays.

By default, the workweek is composed by Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. 
And Saturday and Sunday form the weekend. 

Though most countries has the workweek of Monday to Friday, some have very 
different ones.
